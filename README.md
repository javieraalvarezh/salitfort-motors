# **Capstone project: Providing data-driven suggestions for HR**
# Project Context and Summary
Salifort Motors is a fictional French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer. Its global workforce of over 100,000 employees research, design, construct, validate, and distribute electric, solar, algae, and hydrogen-based vehicles.

Currently, there is a high rate of turnover among Salifort employees. (Note: In this context, turnover data includes both employees who choose to quit their job and employees who are let go).

Salifort surveys a sample of employees to learn more about what might be driving the turnover.

In this project, the survey will be analyzed to come up with ideas for how to increase employee retention.

The steps for this project are the following:

1. Define project scope
2. Project Requirements
3. Plan Stage 
    - Step 1: Imports 
    - Step 2: Data Gathering
3. EDA 
    - Step 1: Data Exploration I (Initial EDA and data cleaning)
    - Step 2: Data Exploration II 
    - Step 3: Model Building 
    - Step 4: Results and Evaluation 
4. Conclusion and Recommendations 

## Project Scope

Analyze survey data about employees in Salifort Motors and design a model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company based on their `department`, `number of projects`,`averaged monthly hours` and any other data points that might be useful for this analysis. 

## Project Requirements

The project is run in a Jupyter Notebook and requires certain libraries, packages and modules to work. If you don't have some of them, then you need to install them using pip install commands.
